^ Hello everybody!

^ Welcome to this cheeky new talk!

^ It can sound strange, but the goal of this talk is to share with you all the findings of an experiment:  finding new ways to bypass a CNCF cool tool called Falco.

^ Falco is a runtime security project and, I should add, Iâ€™m one of its authors

### Security

# [fit] Prevention + Detection

[.column]
Use **policies** to _change the behavior_ of a process by preventing syscalls from succeeding (also killing the process).

[.column]
Use **policies**  to _monitor the behavior_ of a process and notify when its behavior steps outside the policy.

# [fit] Prevention is not enough.
#### Combine with runtime detection tools. Use a [defense-in-depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing) :link: strategy.

# [fit] Runtime Security

Sheâ€™s **Kelly**. :broken_heart:

I have a lock on my front door and an alarm. She alerts me when things arenâ€™t going right, when little bro is misbehaving or if thereâ€™s someone suspicious outside or nearby.

She detects **runtime anomalies** in my life at home.

**Still...** Bad people were able to defy her and break into my house.

## [fit] Let's do it again
## [fit] but in a different way

### video

---

# Mitigations

---

## [fit] Close the outputs gate

### video

---

### Solution?

# [fit] Remove Lua

We started by rewriting outputs gate in C++. (pr grasso)

We plan to also rewrite the parser and the engine completely. So stay in touch!

# [fit] Thanks and Honks!
### [fit] Does anyone have any questions?
